<h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
  <p>
    I have learn't that i can get quite down when i cant get something right or if i dont undertsand something and others around me do, which makes me lose my motivation for work and feel quite demoralised.<br>
    i have learnt that i can be quite annoying as i tend to be a "whistler/hummer" and that this is quite frustrating for poeple who are around me, 
    but i also found it that i tend to only do this when i am stuck and there is a problem that i cant fix,
    so maybe its a coping mechanism isntead of being angry or frustrated i just whistle or hum, i actualy just did it know trying to figure out what to write Next.<br>
    I realised i also try to stay as happy as possible when im stuck or secretly frustrated maybe its not so good to hold in those emotions but i thinks its better.
  </p>
<h4>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
  <p>
    I feel like this makes you not only a good programmer but a good person aswell, aswell as the difference between getting hired and not hired.<br>
    They will help with communication with your team which is key to a succsesful company.
  </p>
<h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
  <p>
    I was suprised at how much of a growth mindset i have than i wouldve originaly thought.
    for example when i was struggling with undertsanding Javascript,<br> i alowed myself time and told myself that this is normal when learning new things,
    and that i shouldnt get stressed out about it and that it will all make sense eventually.
  </p>
<h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
  <p>
    I found it really hard to write about myself, or just writing in general, for whatever reason i struggle alot with it.<br>
    However its good that im doing it and something i will continue to work on it until im confident in myself.
  </p>
<h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
  <p>
   ive realised that it is essential, and what splits the dev academy students up from other learning organisations.<br>
   As dev academy has been saying, people arent looking for poeple who are experts at code anymore, they want people with good social skills
   leadership roles.
  </p>
<h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? 
<br>Justify your answer.</h4>
  <p>
    No i feel like it has made me more aware and feel not as intimidated for when it becomes time to get a job, i dont have to be all too worried about the quality of my code,
    but the vibe that i give off to the interviewers.
