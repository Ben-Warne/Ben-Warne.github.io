      <p>
      I grew up in Surrey in England for about the first 6 years of my life, all of my family lives in the UK.<br> Then my parents and my sister and I moved to the south of France where we lived for about another 6 years,<br> and finally moved to NewZealand where I have been living for 7 years.<br> In school in my final year, one of my friends decided to light a bunch of matches inside a plastic cup,
      a teacher saw and smelt the burning plastic and demanded who had done this terrible act.<br>
      I looked at my friend who wasn’t saying a word and clearly wasn’t going to, so I took the blame even though I wasn’t the one who light the matches.<br> I thought it wouldn’t be that bad just a little scolding sort of thing but it turns out they were going to not allow me to come on the school camp that was happening next week.<br>
      I decided I had to tell the teachers the truth about who did it as it was getting a little too serious for my liking,<br> so I told my friend he had to own up and he did and it was resolved. <br>
      In the beginning I wanted to just cover for my friend, but in the end I couldn’t and it was challenging for me to tell him that he had to own up,<br> for some reason it just felt like I was betraying him. In hindsight however he wasn’t really a good friend and I shouldn’t have tried to take the blame in the first place.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Im unsure of my culture as i never really stayed in one place for too long, but i would say it's probably like my parents,
        which is to work hard and be conscientious, that was the biggest attitude from people who lived in the area of England that my parents did. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I think my strengths would be positivity, optimism and empathy, which i think would help me in my future career incase i have to work with someone difficult.
      I think my weaknesses would probably be procrastinating and sometimes motivation.
      <br>
      I would say I don’t stress a lot I try to keep my cool and just go easy. But sometimes I may go too easy and fall behind slightly because I wasn’t worried enough.<br>
      I always try to be positive no matter what situation I’m in, it helps me be more inspired and hopefully nice for other people too.<br>
      I do get quite distracted at times and find it hard to read with sometimes with minor distractions,<br> and when I’m in a group I just have to work with them or not at all, working with others gives me a boost to be able to work and do what I need to do.<br> And if we struggle I find short breaks are good but not too long otherwise I find it hard to get back into the mode.<br>

        In school i was in a big group project for an accurate geographical map of a specific location, i was with a groups of my friends and naturally
        we didnt actually do much work becuase we wanted to have fun instead, we kept messing around at school and had a really good time but before we knew it we needed to hand our project in.
        So we all got together a powered through quickly out of fear, maybe it was the adrenaline but we ended up handing the project.
        so in the end we did it although if i do remember im pretty sure we got a bad mark but it was still a pass.
        but if we did it all again now i reckon we would do small amounts of work but consistenly therefor we wouldnt have to be a large amount at the end
