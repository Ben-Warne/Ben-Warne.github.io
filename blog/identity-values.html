      <h3>My name is Benjamin Zac Warne</h3>
      <br>
      I grew up in Surrey in England for about the first 6 years of my life, all of my family lives in the UK.<br> Then my parents and my sister and I moved to the south of France where we lived for about another 6 years,<br> and finally moved to NewZealand where I have been living for 7 years.<br> In school in my final year, one of my friends decided to light a bunch of matches inside a plastic cup, a teacher saw and smelt the burning plastic and demanded who had done this terrible act.<br>
       I looked at my friend who wasn’t saying a word and clearly wasn’t going to, so I took the blame even though I wasn’t the one who light the matches.<br> I thought it wouldn’t be that bad just a little scolding sort of thing but it turns out they were going to not allow me to come on the school camp that was happening next week.<br>
      I decided I had to tell the teachers the truth about who did it as it was getting a little too serious for my liking,<br> so I told my friend he had to own up and he did and it was resolved. <br>
      In the beginning I wanted to just cover for my friend, but in the end I couldn’t and it was challenging for me to tell him that the had to own up,<br> for some reason it just felt like I was betraying him. In hindsight however he wasn’t really a good friend and I shouldn’t have tried to take the blame in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      I would say I’m quite forgiving and positive which hopefully gives people a  more positive look on me.<br>
      I would say I don’t stress a lot I try to keep my cool and just go easy. But sometimes I may go too easy and fall behind slightly because I wasn’t worried enough.<br>
      I always try to be positive no matter what situation I’m in, it helps me be more inspired and hopefully nice for other people too.<br>
      I do get quite distracted at times and find it hard to read with sometimes with minor distractions,<br> and when I’m in a group I just have to work with them or not at all, working with others gives me a boost to be able to work and do what I need to do.<br> And if we struggle I find short breaks are good but not too long otherwise I find it hard to get back into the mode.<br>
