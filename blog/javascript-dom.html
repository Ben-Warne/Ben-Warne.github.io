      <!-- JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
      Control flow and loops, arrays and objects
      Functions and why they are useful
      The DOM and DevTools -->
      <h1>Software Languages & Tools</h1>
      <p>Firstly let's start with the difference between HTML and CSS, HTML is what you use for all the writing you see before you, even the title of the browser, so its basically all the visual stuff.</p>
      <p>But it would look quite ugly even though you'd be able to see it all, that's where CSS comes in and make's everything look much nicer like the the background colour that you see aswell as the border, the font and where everything is positioned on the screen.</p>
      <p>
        Then there's Java Script, Java Script is a little more complex compared to HTML and CSS, Java Script is like all the technology behind it all unfortunatly there is no Java Script on my blog because my blog isnt very advanced yet, Java Script can change and use HTML and CSS to its benefit and make it's own calculations and so much more.
        You could say the relationship that all three of these have in common is like a house, Javascript is all the electrical and plumbing and gas in the house, HTML is the foundations of the structure of the building, the walls, floors, ceilings and windows, and CSS is all the paint furniture and decorations.
        there are many different tools we could use in Java Script like these. <br><br>

        Conditionals are where they need a specific result for another specific result.<br><br>
        
       Objects and Arrays, they are quite similar to each other but also used for quite different tasks. Objects are almost everythig in javacsript, they are booleans strings numbers ect, the list goes on, you would use an object for a single task where you only needed one or two objects, you'd be able to access this data quite easily and simply by calling the objects name.
       You would use Arrays however for if you had a number of objects to access and store data from, arrays can hold as many objects as you wish, like a list of items, you could even make a list of items within a list. To access the data from an array you would call the name of the array or the certain object inside the array.
       An object uses {} and an array uses [] here is an example of how you use these in code. An analogy for arrays and objects i would say would be like a librarian,
       the librarian knows exactly where most of the books are, and they have list of all the books ordered alphabeticaly.

        <br>
        Functions are the main thing you will use in javascript, if you ever want to call or return something most of the time you need to make a function.
        A function is how you activate something else you've made, they have bits of code inside them which can do a vast array of things, they even have their own methods inside, its like a whole little world in there.
        In my opinion functions are the one of the most important parts of javacsript and i would say they are more important than console.log.
        Calling a function is like calling room service in a fancy hotel, you tell them what you want and they will deliver.

        
        <br><br>
        Then we have loops, loops are a way you can repeat certain lines of code by linking them together, you are able to loop them as many times as you like, you can even loop infinitly which will actually crash your code editer. There are also three difrrent types of loops, there are for loops, while loops and the do-while loops. The for loop is used to iterate a block statement as many times as you need.
        While loop will also repeat a block statement until a condition is true then it will stop the loop.
        A do-while loop runs the statements it was given and then examines the loops body until the condition is true.

        <p>
          There is also control flow, control flow is how your computer reads the code, it goes from top to bottom running all the code in order unless you have some code like loops. These two are like skiing down a steep mountain, you have the elegance of flow and going from top to bottom, and the repeating process of sharp turns down the mountain to maintain speed.
        </p>

        Next is the DOM the DOM (Document Object Model) is a handy way to visually see your code on the page that your editing and make edits within the dom.
        It is also quite handy to use as a way to see your error messages and help you fix your code. I might use the DOM everytime i check my page to see how im doing, i will know straight away if i have an error as the DOM will have it logged in the Console,
        i can use it to know exactly where the error is being caused, and then i can either go back to my code editor and fix it or fix in the DOM.
