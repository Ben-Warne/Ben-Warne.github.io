      <!-- JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
      Control flow and loops, arrays and objects
      Functions and why they are useful
      The DOM and DevTools -->
      <h1>Software Languages & Tools</h1>
      <p>Firstly let's start with the difference between HTML and CSS, HTML is what you use for all the writing you see before you, even the title of the browser, so its basically all the visual stuff.</p>
      <p>But it would look quite ugly even though you'd be able to see it all, that's where CSS comes in and make's everything look much nicer like the the background colour that you see aswell as the border, the font and where everything is positioned on the screen.</p>
      <p>
        Then there's Java Script, Java Script is a little more complex compared to HTML and CSS, Java Script is like all the technology behind it all unfortunatly there is no Java Script on my blog because my blog isnt very advanced yet, Java Script can change and use HTML and CSS to its benefit and make it's own calculations and so much more.
        You could say the relationship that all three of these have in common is like a house, Javascript is all the electrical and plumbing and gas in the house, HTML is the foundations of the structure of the building, the walls, floors, ceilings and windows, and CSS is all the paint furniture and decorations.
        there are many different tools we could use in Java Script like these. <br><br>

        Conditionals are where they need a specific result for another specific result.<br><br>
        
       Objects and Arrays, they are quite similar to each other but also used for slightly tasks. Objects are almost everythig in javacsript, they are booleans strings numbers ect, the list goes on, you'd be able to access this data quite easily and simply by calling the objects name.
       Arrays however are slightly different they are much like objects only the data by is by numerical order (starting at 0) so you would access it by using the number of which corresponds the the array you wanted.
       An object uses {} and an array uses []. An analogy for arrays and objects i would say would be like a book and a newspaper, with a book you dont skip to different chapters you read it all in order of the chapters, like an array,
       with newpapers however you can skip to any part of the paper that interests you and read all the information, like an object.   
       <br>
    
       
        <br>
        Functions are one of the main things you will use in javascript, they have bits of code inside them which can do a vast array of things,
        they even have their own methods inside, its like a whole little world in there. its quite easy to call a function, all you have to do is write the name of the function,
        then add () at the end, this will call the function very simply and probably wouldnt be used like that most of the time.
        Calling a function is like calling room service in a fancy hotel, you tell them what you want and they will deliver.

        
        <br><br>
        Then we have loops, loops are a way you can repeat certain lines of code by linking them together, you are able to loop them as many times as you like, you can even loop infinitly which will actually crash your code editer.
        i would say loops are like doing donuts in a car, you could keep doing donuts going round and round until something turns false,
        which i suppose in that case would be a popped tire then no more looping donuts round and round.
         </p>   
        <p>
          There is also control flow, control flow is how your computer reads the code, it goes from top to bottom running all the code in order unless you have some code like loops. These two are like skiing down a steep mountain, you have the elegance of flow and going from top to bottom, and the repeating process of sharp turns down the mountain to maintain speed.
        </p>
      <p>
        Next is the DOM the DOM (Document Object Model) is a handy way to visually see your code on the page that your editing and make edits within the dom.
        It is also quite handy to use as a way to see your error messages and help you fix your code. I might use the DOM everytime i check my page to see how im doing, i will know straight away if i have an error as the DOM will have it logged in the Console,
        i can use it to know exactly where the error is being caused, and then i can either go back to my code editor and fix it or fix in the DOM.
