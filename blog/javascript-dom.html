      <h1>Software Languages & Tools</h1>
      <p>Firstly let's start with the difference between HTML and CSS, HTML is what you use for all the writing you see before you, even the title of the browser, so its basically all the visual stuff.</p>
      <p>But it would look quite ugly even though you'd be able to see it all, that's where CSS comes in and make's everything look much nicer like the the background colour that you see aswell as the border, the font and where everything is positioned on the screen.</p>
      <p>Then there's Java Script, Java Script is a little more complex compared to HTML and CSS, Java Script is like all the technology behind it all unfortunatly there is no Java Script on my blog because my blog isnt very advanced yet, Java Script can change and use HTML and CSS to its benefit and make it's own calculations and so much more, there are many different tools we could use in Java Script like these. <br><br>Conditionals where they need a specific result for another specific result.<br><br>Arrays can store various information and use it whenever it is called to.<br><br>Objects are very similiar to arrays but are slightly diffrent objects access its data directly.<br><br>Functions are used to do a particular task, they can call many different types of information like classes and id's.<br><br>Finnally we have loops, loops are pretty self explanatory, they well they loop things, they can basically repeat a line of code or what you want to loop without having to write out the amount of times that you need, it can also make loops with variations in it's loops.</p>
      <p>Next is the DOM the DOM (Document Object Model) is a handy way to visually see your code on the page that your editing and make edits within the dom. It is also quite handy to use as a way to see your error messages and help you fix your code.</P>
