          <br>
          A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning<br>
          I find i can often not stress or freak out if ive been stuck on the same thing for awhile which helps me concentrate. But if i lose motivation it will be so much harder for me to work, especially by myself.
          I often lose motivation when i see a daunting task for the week or just something that i cant figure out, and ill get frustrated and try to do everything to avoid doing it.
          When i start to put of my work i realise that i just need a quick break and do something else, once i come back i usually find that more often than not once i start and actaully try, it doesnt seem as hard as what i thought.

          What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?<br>
          <br>
          I would want to be more charismatic maybe, if i can work with people and have a laugh and a good time then theres no better way to work with others.<br>

          <h2>Learning plan</h2><br>
          A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. <br>
          This should include:<br>
          <br>
          An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
          I could use toggl, be kind to others, communicate well, and keep an open mind.<br>
          <br>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br>
          Take a break, ask for help and tell myself im cool.<br>
          <br>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br>
          I will always my peers and discord first, and then i will ask my facilitators.<br>
          <br>
          A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br>
          I expect them to be able to help at normal hours of the day and be able to support me through my course.<br>
          <br>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.<br>
          I dont really have any commitments except for lunchtime.<br>
