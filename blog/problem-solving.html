  <h3>A story of when i was stuck.</h3>
 <p>
    I was in HTML and CSS trying to make one of my texts green,
    so i decided to use a class system, and assign it the class of green. It should've been simple and easy,
    but it wasn't, it quickly became a big issue as i couldn't progress further in my challenge,
    i started to panic as my text was turning purple instead of my chosen color of green.
 </p>
 <p>
    I started to calm myself, i needed to focus, i thought back to when i was taught problem solving techniques,
    but i didnt actually know many at the time so i just read my code over and over again,
    tried diffrent ways of writing the code, tried to use ID's instead of classes, but it was futile, 
    it seemed there was nothing that could be done to turn my text green.
 </p>
 <p>
    And just as i was getting comfortable with the color purple i realised something after reading my code again,
    there it is, i found the problem. I guess whoever made HTML and CSS were american because i have been spelling the word color all wrong.
    I had been spelling it a true normal person with a U colour. I changed the spelling and sure enough it worked like a charm,
    i had finnally achieved the color (colour) green.
 </p>
    To this day i still dont know why a U in colour made the text turn purple,
    but i learned from it and have decided maybe Americans can spell properly, so i shall spell color as colour again.
 </p>
 <p>
   But really what i learnt most of all is that spelling is critical, a small mistake like that had such a big impact on what i was doing,
   so know whenever something goes wrong i always check my spelling first.

 <h2>Problem solving techniques</h2>
 <p>
   I have learnt many techniques now here are some that i know.
 </p>

   <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
    <p>
   Pseudocode is a technique where you write comments withing the line of code to help yourself. i think it is a good idea and im not good at it yet but it seems like a good idea.
   </p>
     <br>
  <h4>Trying something</h4>
    <p>
      Trying something is always good, i just try something even if im pretty sure it wont work but sometimes it does!
    </p>
      <br>
  <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
    <p>
      I have never tried the rubber ducky method but i have heard about it, it's where you get a little rubber ducky or something similiar and you talk to it and tell it what youre doing,
      and hopefully you will notice something as you say it aloud.
    </p>
      <br>
  <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
    <p>
      Reading error messages are super helpful, atleast most of they are anyway, sometimes they will tell you exactly whats wrong and you can fix it.
      othertimes they are not very clear, but atleast it's telling me something is wrong.
    </p>
      <br>
  <h4>Console.log</h4>
  <p>
    Console.logging is helpful, although i havent really used it all that much yet.
  </p>
    <br>
  <h4>Googling</h4>
  <p>
    Googing is very helpful soemtimes if i word my question right i get just what im looking for and othertimes it is a minefield of nonsense.
  </p>
    <br>
  <h4>Asking peers for help</h4>
  <p>
    This is my favourite method, all i have to do is ask everyone and soon after someone will be helping me and ill always get it right in the end.
  </p>
    <br>
  <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
  <p>
    I havent specifcally gone a facilitator yet, but when i ask in discord sometimes a facilitator will reply, they are like gods of code, very helpful.
  </p>
    <br>
  <h4>Improving my process with reflection</h4>
  <p>
   I really enjoy reflecting as it's like a sense of reward, after finsihing a challenge i get to reflect and be done with it,
   im a fan.
